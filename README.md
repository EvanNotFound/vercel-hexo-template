# Hexo Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration. 

This version is created by [EvanNotFound](https://github.com/EvanNotFound/vercel-hexo-template), which uses the latest hexo version v6.3.0 and fixed some bugs compared to the official template.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Hexo project with Vercel.

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Hexo for deployment with Vercel, you can use the [Hexo CLI](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html#Installation) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ hexo init project-name
```
